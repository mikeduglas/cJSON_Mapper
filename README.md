## Usage
Drop json file on to the left pane, or select a file via file dialog, or just paste json text. The generated Clarion code will appears on the right pane immediately which you can save as a CLW file or copy into clipboard.  
There are some options to handle resulting output:  
- "External names" adds a NAME attribute to the fields declaration.
- "Comments" adds a comment to the fields declaration.
- "Rounding up" rounds string sizes up to the next power of 2.
- "Generate program" generates complete program file instead of pure struct declaration statement.

Unfortunately, Windows Defender may report "Threats detected" or "Virus detected" when the download of cJSON_Mapper-master.zip completes.
